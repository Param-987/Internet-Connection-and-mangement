        <div class="slide one">We have a great SIM only deal: Â£5 a month for 2.25 gb 4G plus calls and texts. Reliable. Data is fast. Can roll over data too. Very happy.</div>
        <div class="slide two">I found idnet to be very very reliable. Their customer service is 2nd to none. Although a little on the expensive side you really do get what you pay for.</div>
        <div class="slide three" >Technical support and customer service have been first-class. IDNET may not been the cheapest but provides great value-for-money and in our experience a hassle-free life.</div>
        <div class="slide four" >Absolutely no trouble. They even phone you to check everything AOK after a query.</div>
        <div class="slide five" >I've been with Idnet from the get go, simply the best. Speed, customer service second to none</div>
