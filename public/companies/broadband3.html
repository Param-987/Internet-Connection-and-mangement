        <h1>Beginner's Guide to Mobile Broadband</h1>

        <div class="dash">
            <img class="ques" src="../photos/thinking.png"> <h2>What is Mobile Broadband??</h2>
            <p>Mobile Broadband refers to an Internet access technology which uses the mobile phone network for access. This is different from "wireless broadband" which is used when referring to "wireless hotspots" such as cafes, hotels or airport lounges which provide Internet access or "wireless routers" which you install on a fixed phone line in the home. A mobile broadband service can be used anywhere within a coverage area (including abroad), just like your mobile phone although it is important to understand that the speeds you get may vary just like with fixed line services. Some mobile broadband providers such as EE offer 'fixed line' broadband services as well, so make sure you know what you're buying. <br><br>Although mobile internet access has been around for many years, the speeds have recently increased to provide "broadband" level services. We regard a service as 'broadband' when its downstream speed generally exceeds 250Kbps (kilobits per second). This is equivalent to "0.25 meg".

            <img class="ques" src="../photos/thinking.png"> <h2>Which is better: Mobile or fixed line broadband?</h2>
            <p>This depends entirely on what your broadband requirements are. Some people find the flexibility of being able to use the service away from home make mobile broadband ideal, but if you are streaming TV / music, or you play online role playing games, mobile broadband may not be suitable.

            <img class="ques" src="../photos/thinking.png"><h2>What hardware do I need?</h2>
            <p>In order to use mobile broadband you will need a modem and a SIM card similar to the one in your mobile phone. You can get both of these from your network operator, although it is worth noting many new laptops have 3G/4G broadband modems built in (which may perform better due to the antenna being inside the laptop screen in some cases, or worse because it's older; you need to check. These may be found under a battery).
<br><br>
                The most common modem is called the 'USB dongle' which is quite small these days, but you may still find ExpressCard modems as well. In addition, it is possible to buy mobile broadband 'routers' which allow more than one person to share the connection.

            <img class="ques" src="../photos/thinking.png"> <h2>Should I get mobile broadband?</h2>
            <p>This depends on your individual requirements. Generally speaking, if you browse the web, check e-mail, shop online and so on, mobile broadband will often perform well. If you use very 'bandwidth intensive' applications like downloading lots of music or videos, or you share the connection with family or housemates, you'll probably be better off with a fixed line connection.</p>

        <div class="dash">
            <img class="ques" src="../photos/thinking.png"> <h2>How many gigabytes will I need each month?</h2>
            <p>Broadband service providers will often sell services based on how many gigabytes (GB) you want to download each month. This allows them to charge a higher price those using their connection more.
<br><br>
                A fixed line broadband user is likely to use a few GB each month whilst an intensive user might well reach 100GB per month. Mobile broadband packages tend to be suitable for low level users. Use of video sites like YouTube or iPlayer is likely to significantly increase usage. You can use our tbbMeter download monitor tool to see how much you use.</p>
