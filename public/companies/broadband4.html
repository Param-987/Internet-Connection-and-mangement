        <h1>How Broadband Works (for techies)</h1>

        <div class="dash">
            <img class="ques" src="../photos/thinking.png"> <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Broadband can be very complex and we try to make sure our site is accessible to everyone, however some of our more technically savvy users want to know a bit more about how the different flavours of broadband work.  <strong> This page is for the geeks who want technical detail!</strong> <br><br>
                
                Broadband started to be rolled out in the UK in the year 2000 and from 2009 and onwards fibre based broadband started to appear, will hopefully explain away some of the myths and help you to understand the many acronyms that are flying around and see behind the curtain of confusion sometimes created by marketing terminology.

            <img class="ques" src="../photos/thinking.png" alt=""><h2>Mobile (3G, 4G/LTE, 5G)</h2>
            <p>Speeds delivered by small mobile devices has improved immensely in the last few years, and much of this is down to advancements in signal processing, i.e. very faster and smaller processors mean more data is being squeezed out of the radio spectrum. <br><br>

                Mobile operators have their own radio allocation, with Ofcom running auctions for spectrum when it becomes available, an unfortunate side effect of this is that some mobile operators have more spectrum than offers or have a section of spectrum that is suited to long distances i.e. need less mobile masts.
                <br><br>
                The spectrum for 3G was auctioned off in 2000 and for a few years felt very fast, but in 2017 if your mobile falls from 4G back to 3G things feel very slow, a lot of this is that latency on 3G was never great, 100ms or worse and many websites and apps on smartphones are making lots of small data requests which makes high latency much more noticeable, plus individual web pages are much larger in terms of Mega Bytes. <br><br>
                
                4G in the UK saw its spectrum auction take place in 2013 and 4G brought much higher speeds than 3G, you could say 4G is the superfast mobile broadband compared to old fashioned ADSL like 3G. 4G as well as boosting download and upload speeds also reduced latency, and with improvements to the 4G standard mobile broadband speeds are increasing annually, to the point now where the best speeds can be in the 100 to 200 Mbps region. <br><br>
                
                Unfortunately 3G and 4G are reliant on a mast, and while rule changes allow higher masts and make planning permission easier have improved coverage there is still lots more to do. One problem that can strike 4G services (and was seen on the old 3G services too) is that if you get too many people in a small area that the mobile mast will not cope with the number of devices, or if the mast does cope the actual bandwidth used will mean everyone slows down to the point of it not working. Solutions such as small cells are being increasingly deployed in places like train stations to cope with rush hour etc.
                <br><br>
                5G is the next evolution of mobile broadband and while a lot is promised, many will remember similar promises from 3G and 4G. 5G does appear to offer exceptional latency performance potentially down to 1 ms and while labs having demonstrations of speed tests far in excess of Gbps this will only be achieved when very close to a mast and for the ultra high frequencies used in the demonstrations (60 GHz) a single sheet of paper is enough to block the signal. Therefore while 5G will be a big change compared to 4G, the big promises of replacing fixed line broadband will only come to fruition if 100,000's of new mobile masts are installed - the clever part is that 5G masts are likely to be so small they will fit into street furniture such as traffic signs and lamp posts. Other improvements include using multiple frequencies at the same time in a mobile handset, so even seeing just a second or two of Gigabit speeds means a video can buffer masses of data and doing this seamlessly unlike the slow hops you see now as a mobile phone flips between 4G and 3G.

            <img class="ques" src="../photos/thinking.png" alt=""> <h2>Satellite Broadband</h2>
            <p>Two way satellite broadband where you use a satellite dish to transmit and receive data to a geo stationary satellite that is positioned above the equator some 32,000km from the earth means you can get broadband almost anywhere that you can see the southern sky.
<br><br>
                The size of the satellite dish is smaller in 2017 than a decade ago and is usually similar in size to a Sky TV satellite dish, and can be wall mounted or if needed mounted on a pole on the ground e.g. to the side of a property to ensure line of sight to the satellite. As alignement with the the geostationary satellite is even more critical than with satellite TV due to the two way nature of the signal a professional install is needed, but the cost of this can often be covered by a broadband voucher or spread over the term of the broadband contract.
                <br><br>
                Once your data reaches the geo stationary satellite it is sent to a larger ground station, and from there starts its journey down fibre to where ever you are visiting on the Internet.
                <br><br>
                The return journey means that the signal takes some time to reach the satellite and then return to earth, so satellite broadband is not good for latency sensitive tasks such as many online games due to the 800ms of latency (ADSL2+ is around 30ms, VDSL2+ 10 to 20ms and FTTP can be down to 1ms) but for those where no other options are available it does mean web access, video streaming and file downloads are possible. Costs are also coming down over time so video streaming, etc. is becoming more possible on these services.
                <br><br>
                Download speeds vary from 2 Mbps all the way to 30 Mbps, with a best upload speed of 6 Mbps generally. Satellite broadband packages generally have a usage limit to try and manage peak time capacity, but many will offer unlimited downloads over night, so a common thing to do is schedule large downloads to the midnight to 6am period.
                <br><br>
                There are future development plans afoot to deploy a cloud of satellites in a much lower orbit, and while none of them will be stationary relative to your position on the earth if enough satellites are in this low earth orbit you will always have visibility of one and modern electronics makes handling switching between satellites a lot simpler than a decade ago. The closer orbit could well bring latency back into line with ADSL2+ services and much improved download and upload speeds, but for now this is just theory.</p>

            <img class="ques" src="../photos/thinking.png" ><h2>Fixed Wireless (WiMAX)</h2>
            <p>Wireless has existined for many years, but what distinguishes fixed wireless from mobile and Wi-Fi is that the aerial is fixed to the property. Potentially the aerial could be a small one located indoors but brick walls are not a friend of wireless signals thus much better reception is gained with an external antenna and ideally located as high as possible, in fact very similar rules to attaching a TV aerial to a property.
<br><br>
                The antenna on a property is usually oriented so that it has line of sight to the local mast (or near line of sight - which means limited obstructions are not an issue). The masts can be dedicated to the fixed wireless service, or co-exist with other services such as mobile on a mast. While some masts may have a single antenna providing a near 360 degree bubble of coverage, most deployments have multiple antenna splitting an area into sectors, thus improving coverage and also reducing the number of people you share your section of the radio spectrum with.
                <br><br>
                In the early days some fixed wireless services relied on the unlicensed Wi-Fi spectrum but as Wi-Fi devices exploded in shere volume operators have moved to different parts of the spectrum where they have better control.
                <br><br>
                Developments since the first fixed wireless services appeared mean it has seen increasing speeds and services are starting to be deployed that can provide ultrafast speeds. The exact speeds you will receive depend on many factors, but distance to the mast and the amount of obstructions are the main limit, for this reason fixed wireless providers will not normally guarantee service until a site visit has taken place.</p>

            <img class="ques"src="../photos/thinking.png"><h2>Cable Broadband</h2>
            <p>The main cable broadband provider in the UK is Virgin Media, but the Isle of Wight does have an independent cable operator called Wight Fibre.
<br><br>
                Cable broadband is based around DOCSIS technology and utilises a fibre to the node layout, where fibre carries data to and from a local cabinet, which then has subsiduary cabinets joined to it via co-axial cable. The link from your local subsiduary cabinet to your property is over a coax cable, i.e. single metal core with insulator and braided metal outer under a final layer of insulation (an additional pair of copper wires is used to provide a telephone service). DOCSIS 3.0 is the current data standard used in the UK and fastest download speed sold currently is 350 Mbps with various upload speeds up to 20 Mbps, the newer standard DOCSIS 3.1 which should allow Gigabit (1000 Mbps) speeds to be offered is expected before 2020.
                <br><br>
                Cable broadband is a fixed speed connection since the cabinets are always located at a distance which means the attenuation of the coax cable is not an issue.
                <br><br>
                Virgin Media sells three main speeds at present with 100 Mbps, 200 Mbps and 300 Mbps top speeds and to ensure the 10% advertising rule is met speeds are over provisioned, so if local congestion is not impacting you on the 200 Mbps service speed tests of 210 Mbps are actually possible. Local congestion can be an issue for cable broadband and with people doing more and more with their broadband this does lead to some areas performing worse than others, and this leads us onto the median download speed of 55 Mbps on the 100 Mbps service, 46 Mbps on the 200 Mbps service and 86 Mbps on the 300 Mbps service.
                <br><br>
                Virgin Media is expanding its network footprint with an eventual aim of covering around two thirds of UK premises, this roll-out is a mixture of extending the existing network but where areas are totally new then full fibre is used, i.e. fibre to the premises, this roll-out is often referred to as Project Lightning. For those areas with full fibre is used the same broadband modems and TV set-top is used as a convertor is used to take the light signals and convert this into the usual coax format, this way of using FTTP is called RFOG. The full fibre areas currently do not support a telephone service, but it is expected that Virgin Media will offer a Voice of Internet Protocol (VoIP) service in the near future.</p>
